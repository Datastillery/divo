# Docker Compose

Docker Compose instructions are passed to the `docker-compose` binary on your Docker engine host as either a yaml- or json-formatted document with maps defining the container services, networks, and volumes needed to run the services as an interconnected stack of components (as well as a compose file version). The keys in the underlying map structure generally have a one-to-one relationship to the various arguments available to the `docker run` command.

For more details, see the full [docker compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)
